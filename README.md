# hello-world
Really I'm a noob looking to make a headway in programming. I really wanna learn java and how to speed write. I have to look at the screen most times to ensure that I am typing the right thing. It could get annoying trying to type without looking. But I am very positive that I will this skill in no time. To type faster, I have to look at the keyboard which is a bad habbit because i can make mistakes without even knowing. I think i just made a headway. Think about the word intentionally, then reproduce it with your fingers. Thinkthen reproduce. Some words are quite long and would require practice but give it time, it will come to you. Thinkit through, and it will come to you.

This long body of text was written to prove that the right hand side is actually the problem here especially the p side of things.
Look at it like this. The righthand side takes a lot of time to boot. Literally like 2 secs. That's like increase the time it takes to display a video file by one sec.
